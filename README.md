## Description as appears on CTAN

Pybib provides a set of command line utilities (written in Python) to check, merge, sort, filter, and convert BibTeX files. Also include a tool to lookup references on Google scholar and insert the URL into the file.

The package builds on the authorâ€™s experience writing the earlier tkbibtex; it is hoped that this code is more readily maintainable.

## Setup

1. `$ git clone https://github.com/cmower/pybib.git`
1. On Linux/Mac add `export BIBPATH="/path/to/pybib"; export PATH=$PATH:$BIBPATH` to your `.bashrc`/`.bash_profile`. If you use Windows set the environment variables `BIBPATH` and update your `PATH` variable to contain `BIBPATH` (untested for Windows).
