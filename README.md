# Pybib

Pybib provides a set of command line utilities (written in Python) to check, merge, sort, filter, and convert BibTeX files.

## Setup

## Requirements

## List of modifications to Peter Corke's original code

## Description as appears on CTAN

Pybib provides a set of command line utilities (written in Python) to check, merge, sort, filter, and convert BibTeX files. Also include a tool to lookup references on Google scholar and insert the URL into the file.

The package builds on the authorâ€™s experience writing the earlier tkbibtex; it is hoped that this code is more readily maintainable.
